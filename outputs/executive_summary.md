# Executive Summary — Superstore Strategy Analysis

## Objective
Understand sales performance drivers (mix, seasonality, customer concentration) and propose revenue + retention strategies.

## Dataset
- 9,800 transactions
- Sales-only schema (no profit/discount/quantity)

## Key Findings
1) **Seasonality:** monthly sales spikes in [months] (see monthly trend).
2) **Regional mix:** top region contributes X% of sales.
3) **Category concentration:** top category contributes X% of sales.
4) **Customer concentration:** top 10 customers contribute X% of sales.
5) **Shipping speed:** ship mode differences (avg ship days) suggest ops opportunities.

## Recommendations

- Upsell “Loyal/Champions” with bundles in top sub-categories.
- Improve service levels for high-value segments where ship days are slow.

## Deliverables
- Day 2 charts + report in `outputs/`
- Day 3 forecast + RFM segments in `outputs/`
